# 🌊 RiverLens – Real-Time Hydrological Monitoring System 🌊

**Intelligent and open freshwater quality monitoring.**  
Real-time, accessible, and predictive hydrological data.  

🚀 **Status:** In development | 🌍 **License:** Open Source | 📡 **Technologies:** Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL/PostGIS, IoT, Machine Learning

## 📌 The Problem  

Currently, there is no **real-time, accessible system** for monitoring **freshwater quality**. Governments and companies rely on **fragmented, outdated, and inaccessible data**.  

🌎 **12% of the world's freshwater is in Brazil**, yet we lack effective tools to protect it.  
⚠️ **Water crises, pollution, and contamination** are advancing without proper monitoring.  
📉 **Lack of open data** prevents efficient policymaking and data-driven decisions.  

**RiverLens** solves this by creating a **distributed system for collecting, processing, and forecasting hydrological data**, focusing on **water quality, pollution, and river flow**.

## 🔬 How It Works  

**RiverLens** integrates data from IoT sensors, hydrometeorological stations, and public sources into an **open and structured data pipeline**, combining:  

✅ **Data Collection & Streaming**: Physical sensors, government APIs, and satellite imagery.  
✅ **Processing & Predictive Modeling**: Machine learning (LSTMs, Random Forest) to detect hydrological anomalies.  
✅ **RESTful APIs + WebSockets**: Real-time data access for developers and researchers.  
✅ **Geospatial Database**: PostgreSQL/PostGIS optimized for hydrological queries.  
✅ **Visualization & Dashboards**: Open interfaces for data analysis.  

📡 *Future plans include integrating Edge Computing for independent IoT sensors and Blockchain for data integrity verification.*
