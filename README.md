🌊 RiverLens – Open-Source Hydrological Monitoring

RiverLens is an open-source, real-time hydrological monitoring system that collects, processes, and predicts freshwater quality using IoT sensors, machine learning, and geospatial data.

🚀 Why?
12% of the world's freshwater is in Brazil, yet there is no real-time, accessible monitoring system for pollution, water levels, and environmental risks. RiverLens aims to democratize hydrological data, enabling governments, researchers, and communities to make informed decisions.

🔍 How it works:
✅ IoT + Open Data: Sensor networks + public APIs + satellite imagery
✅ AI-Powered Predictions: Machine learning for anomaly detection & forecasting
✅ Open REST APIs & WebSockets: Real-time access for devs and researchers
✅ Geospatial Database: PostgreSQL + PostGIS for hydrological queries
✅ Scalable Infrastructure: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP

💡 Join the Project!
We are looking for developers, data scientists, and hydrology experts. Open issues, submit PRs, and help build the future of water monitoring!
